# Chess+

Chess game for two players, made in JavaScript. Originally done for my Computer Graphics course in Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. This repository is a fork of that version (https://github.com/Lucas-CG/Xadrez), and here I will do fixes, code cleanup and add more features whenever I have time, to practice my coding.

<h2>Demo</h2>

You can play a demo <a href = "http://lucas-cg.github.io/Xadrez/">HERE</a>. However, it's still in Portuguese (will be changed soon).

If you wish, you can download the repo and run the game locally. However, you will need to service it in a Web server, because the app dinamically loads textures and 3D models.

<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking a chess piece: shows available movements (if any)</li>
  <li>Clicking on a marked square: moves a previously selected piece to the clicked square</li>
  <li>Clicking and dragging the cursor: turns the camera around</li>
  <li>Pressing R: allows the player to choose a set of textures to the pieces. Input "r" for the default set (black and white) and "m" for the wooden set.</li>
</ul>
